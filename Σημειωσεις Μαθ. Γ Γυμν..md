[Why define polynomials like that ?](https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-the-variable-in-a-polynomial-have-a-fraction-or-decimal-as-its-exponent)

Polynomials have a number of nice properties, 

 - in that on one hand they behave a lot like integers (they can be added, subtracted and multiplied, some divide evenly into others, we can compute greatest common divisors, etc), 
 - they are completely characterized by their roots. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, every non-zero polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots (possibly non-unique).
 - if you substitute a polynomial into another polynomial, you always get another polynomial.
 - There are two fundamental reasons/properties of polynomials explaining :  
	### 1) All polynomials have a domain of R
	If we take the a simple example of a negative integer exponent algebraic expression such a 1/x, it's not defined for x=0 hence violating the first property.  
	Similarly, x^(1/2) is not defined for negative real numbers.  
	### 2) Anti derivatives and derivatives of polynomials are polynomials
	If we consider 1/x to be a polynomial, we get its anti derivative as lnx which is obviously not a polynomial.
