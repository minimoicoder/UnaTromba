## Common Symptoms of Hypothyroidism
Below are **major symptoms** associated with hypothyroidism.

- Fatigue
- Weakness
- Weight gain or difficulty losing weight (despite reduced food intake)
- Coarse, dry hair and dry skin
- *Hair loss*
- Sensitivity to cold
- Muscle cramps and aches
- Constipation
- Depression
- Irritability
- Memory loss
- Abnormal menstrual cycles
- Decreased libido
- Slowed speech (severe cases)
- Jaundice (severe cases)
- Increase in tongue size (severe cases)

You don't have to encounter every one of these symptoms to be diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Every patient's experience with the disorder is 
different.


### Questions to Ask Your Doctor
- What TSH level will you use as a target for me? 
- After I'm in the optimal range, how often do you suggest I come back   for blood tests to make sure my dosage needs haven't changed? 
- Am I at risk for related health problems? 
- How quickly can I expect relief from my hypothyroid symptoms? 
- Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to relieve my symptoms?

## Subclinical Hypothyroidism
if you have subclinical hypothyroidism, meaning your TSH is **mildly elevated** (let's say around 6.0 mU/L) and your thyroxine (T4) level is normal, the fact that you have positive TPO antibodies may 
influence your doctor into treating you with a low dose of thyroid hormone replacement medication. 

Your doctor may be even more swayed to treat (or try it out) if you are having hypothyroid symptoms, like constipation, depression, or scalp hair loss. 

The main reason behind initiating therapy is that treating subclinical hypothyroidism may prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism (when your TSH is elevated and your T4 level is low).

### Treating Subclinical Hypothyroidism: Other Factors to Keep in Mind
In addition to the 
- presence of TPO antibodies and 
- whether you have symptoms, 

your doctor will consider other factors when deciding whether or not to treat subclinical hypothyroidism: 

- *Age* 
   One factor is ageâ€”TSH levels may rise with increasing age, even in people without thyroid disease. This is why a doctor may prescribe thyroid hormone replacement medication for a younger person with a mildly elevated TSH, normal T4, and positive TPO antibodies, but not for an older person (over the age of 60) with the same blood test results; although, a "watch and wait" approach is often taken, meaning you will have your TSH periodically checked to see if it rises. 

- *Other Health Problems* 
   Having a family history of thyroid disease or a personal history of high cholesterol may further sway a doctor into treating subclinical hypothyroidism. 



While thyroid hormone replacement medication is generally 
well-tolerated, there are some **potential downsides** to initiating 
treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism. 

One major concern is the risk of **overtreatment**, meaning a person becomes hyperthyroid, which can put them at risk of developing **atrial fibrillation** and **osteoporosis**. 

Other potential downsides include cost, inconvenience, and the 
"medicalization" of a normal condition.
